## 💡 About The Project
VibeBites is a frontend web application that reimagines the food ordering experience. Instead of scrolling through endless menus, users filter food based on their **current mood** (Party, Comfort, Spicy). It features a fully functional cart, checkout simulation, and a live delivery tracking animation.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Mood-Based Filtering:** One-click sorting for "Party Mode", "Comfort Food", and "Spicy Cravings".
* **Live Search:** Real-time search bar to find specific dishes instantly.
* **Smart Cart:** Dynamic floating cart that calculates totals and tracks quantities (e.g., 2x Butter Chicken).
* **Gen Z UI/UX:** Glassmorphism, neon accents, and dark mode aesthetic.
* **Live Tracking Simulation:** A visual map animation showing the delivery partner moving towards the home icon with a countdown timer.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox, Grid, CSS Variables, and Keyframe Animations.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** DOM manipulation, array filtering, cart logic, and `setInterval` for timers.
* **Google Fonts:** 'Plus Jakarta Sans' for modern typography.
